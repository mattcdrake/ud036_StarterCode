# ud036_StarterCode

## Goal

Generates a website that shows the posters and trailers of my favorite movies - part of the first FSND project. 

## Running 

On Linux, you can get this to run by cloning the repo and then running `entertainment_center.py` which should open the generated web site in your given browser.
